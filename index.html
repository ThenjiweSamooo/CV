                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I've always loved art and expressing myself creatively, and very quickly got into art and design as a teenager. I got into creating websites, mostly to display my art. That was very easy though, as I used website builders, of course. And in trying to challenge myself more, I decided to also start learning coding. I come from a family of programmers, critical thinkers, problem solvers - who've always encouraged that I get into this field. After years of avoiding this type of work which I condisdered hard and strenuous, I must say, it's really fulfilling! </p>

                <p>I've freelanced as a digital illustrator for about 2 years now, mostly working with small businesses around me. I'm also good at photography, with a photography course credit under my belt. My photography, I mostly use for mixed medium art and my own platform content creation.</p>
